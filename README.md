# Ameeq
Building Deep learning library from scratch in python (starting from linear algebra framework until deep learning implementaion) 

## examples files containing the following:
### 1. simple function from scratch implementation
### 2. simple implementation for the basic logic gates to be learned (you can choose the logic list from the code)
### 3. simple implementation for XOR gate with only python code 
### 3. same implementation for XOR gate but using numpy and linear algebra
