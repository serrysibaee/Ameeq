# Ameeq
Building Deep learning library from scratch in python (starting from linear algebra framework until deep learning implementaion) 

## examples files containing the following:
### 1. simple function from scratch implementation
### 2. simple implementation for the basic logic gates to be learned (you can choose the logic list from the code)
### 3. simple implementation for XOR gate with only python code 
### 4. same implementation for XOR gate but using numpy and linear algebra  


## safifah file
### 1. matrix_op file is created to represent the matrix operations with randomness to use it as basis for the model creation (containing Safifah Object)
### 2. main file is for creating the model with forward and backward operations
